# Telegram Bot Module

This folder contains the code for the Telegram bot module of our project. The Telegram bot serves as the user interface for interacting with the system.

## Overview

The Telegram bot allows users to send images, and in return, they receive modified images, all within the same Telegram chat. The bot integrates seamlessly with the other modules of the project to provide a user-friendly and engaging experience.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Users can send pictures to the bot, and it will send an image back. As of now the user will get just an image with a detected face.
 
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The bot provides an intuitive interface for interacting with the image processing system, making it easy for users to enjoy and experiment with the service.

- **Real-time Feedback**: Users receive generated images in real-time, allowing for instant feedback and interaction.
