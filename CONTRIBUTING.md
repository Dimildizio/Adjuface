I welcome contribution from the community to help make this project even better! Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a feature, or contribute code, here's how you can get involved:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top of the repository to create your own copy of the project.

2. **Create a Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. Branch names should be clear and descriptive of the feature or bug you're addressing.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature


3. **Make Changes**: Write your code, fix the bug, or make your improvements. Be sure to follow the coding style and conventions to maintain code consistency.

4. **Test**: Ensure that your changes do not introduce new issues and that all existing tests pass successfully.

5. **Commit**: Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message following the pattern:

- `feat(segment): Your commit message` for adding new features.
- `fix(segment): Your commit message` for fixing bugs.
- `doc(segment): Your commit message` for documentation updates.
- `refactor(segment): Your commit message` for code refactoring.

 **Example commits**:

- `feat(model): Add U-Net architecture` # For adding a new model.
- `fix(bot): Resolve issue with message handling` # For fixing a bot-related issue.

6. **Push**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feat/my-new-feature

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a new Pull Request. Clearly describe the changes you've made and provide any relevant information.

8. **Review and Approval**: I will review your Pull Request. If further changes or improvements are needed, I'll provide feedback and guidance. Once your changes meet the standards, I'll approve the PR.

9. **Merging**: I will merge your approved Pull Request into the main project.

10.  **Thank You!**: Your contribution to the project is greatly appreciated. Thank you for helping make this project better.

Please remember to follow the commit message pattern and contribute to the project following these guidelines. I encourage collaboration and look forward to your contributions!
